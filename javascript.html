<h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
	<p>
	A JavaScript Object can be understood in terms of a real life object.  It can have
	<em>properties</em> that describe it, and <em>methods</em> or actions that it can
	perform.  A method is treated similar to a function.
	</p>
	<p>
	Like a variable, an object can have a value assigned to it.  However, an object can
	have multiple values.  An object is created by assigning a value to it, such as
	var guitar = {type:'electric', strings:'six', color:'red'};
	</p>
	<p>
	An object can be called in two ways,<br>
	guitar.type, or
	guitar[type]
	</p>
	<p>
	For a method, it is accessed by:<br>
	guitar.toneUp()
	</p>
